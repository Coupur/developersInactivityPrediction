My proposed solution is to introduce a new argument, rowwise = FALSE.

Approach:

- This is a non-breaking change; the default behavior of shifting within list cells remains the same.
- The implementation is minimal and efficient. When rowwise=TRUE, the C code will wrap the list column in a temporary list of length one. This allows the existing VECSXP logic to perform the row-wise shift correctly without a major rewrite.

Please let me know if this approach sounds good before I prepare a pull request.
Thanks"
